Text and Image Generation with OpenAI GPT-3

## Description

This [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app generates texts and images using OpenAI's GPT-3 based Davinci model for texts and DALLÂ·E for images.

## Contribution

I hope this will be of value to people seeking to understand GPT-3's current capabilities and the overall progress of natural language processing (NLP) and generative AI. Plus maybe you can even use the app to generate some interesting texts or images.

In order to use this app you can do

```
$ git clone imarranz/streamlit-openai-app
```

and run

```
$ streamlit run streamlit-openai-app
```

You will need use your own account in openai.
